# fumo-api
The first api to obtain images of fumos
## How to use 
 for the moment it only has two functions 
 - randomfumo()
 - fumo()

 use `randomfumo()` to get a random fumo from the library 

 use `fumo(number)` to get an specific fumo 
 
 ## Example 
 here is an example for use fumo-api
 ```js
 const fumos = require('fumo-api') 

var anyfumo = fumos.randomfumo()

 console.log(anyfumo)
 ```
